# Mac Development Ansible Playbook

[![CI][badge-gh-actions]][link-gh-actions]

This playbook installs and configures most of the software I use on my Mac for web and software development. Some things in macOS are slightly difficult to automate, so I still have some manual installation steps, but at least it's all documented here.

This is a work in progress, and is mostly a means for me to document my current Mac's setup. I'll be evolving this playbook over time.

## Installation

  1. Ensure Apple's command line tools are installed (`xcode-select --install` to launch the installer).
  1. Enable Rosetta2 `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`
  1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) ```bash
          /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh>)"

     ```
          Add Homebrew to your **PATH**: (the installer will tell you to)
  1. `brew install ansible`
     Add to path:

     ```
     echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> ~/.zprofile
     eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
     ```

  3. Clone this repository to your local drive. `git clone https://github.com/Joostvanderlaan/mac-dev-playbook.git`
  4. Go into this repo directory `cd mac-dev-playbook` and run `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` to install required Ansible roles.
  5. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory --ask-become-pass`. Enter your account password when prompted. Or only the homebrew stuff with `ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory -K --tags "homebrew" --ask-become-pass`

### Alternatively, install Ansible manually

  3. [Install Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html). (pip install)

      ```shell
      # install pip
      curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
      python3 get-pip.py --user
      # install ansible
      python3 -m pip install --user ansible
      ```

       1. In case of cryptography.io complaining about missing Rust (first install brew, see above):
          Install Rust:

          ```
          brew install openssl@1.1 rust
          ```

          install cryptography using openssl as MacOS uses LibreSSL:

          ```bash
          env LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)/lib" CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)/include" pip install cryptography
          ```

          Re-run the ansible install above

### Use with a remote Mac

You can use this playbook to manage other Macs as well; the playbook doesn't even need to be run from a Mac at all! ([Install ansible on Ubuntu & others])(<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-ubuntu>) If you want to manage a remote Mac, either another Mac on your network, or a hosted Mac like the ones from [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com), you just need to make sure you can connect to it with SSH:

  1. (On the Mac you want to connect to:) Go to System Preferences > Sharing.
  2. Enable 'Remote Login'.

> You can also enable remote login on the command line:
>
>     sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on

Then edit the `inventory` file in this repository and change the line that starts with `127.0.0.1` to:

```
[ip address or hostname of mac]  ansible_user=[mac ssh username]
```

If you need to supply an SSH password (if you don't use SSH keys), make sure to pass the `--ask-pass` parameter to the `ansible-playbook` command.

### Running a specific set of tagged tasks

You can filter which part of the provisioning process to run by specifying a set of tags using `ansible-playbook`'s `--tags` flag. The tags available are `dotfiles`, `homebrew`, `mas`, `extra-packages` and `osx`.

    ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory -K --tags "dotfiles,homebrew"

## Overriding Defaults

Not everyone's development environment and preferred software configuration is the same.

You can override any of the defaults configured in `default.config.yml` by creating a `config.yml` file and setting the overrides in that file. For example, you can customize the installed packages and apps with something like:

    homebrew_installed_packages:
      - cowsay
      - git
      - go
    
    mas_installed_apps:
      - { id: 443987910, name: "1Password" }
      - { id: 498486288, name: "Quick Resizer" }
      - { id: 557168941, name: "Tweetbot" }
      - { id: 497799835, name: "Xcode" }
    
    composer_packages:
      - name: hirak/prestissimo
      - name: drush/drush
        version: '^8.1'
    
    gem_packages:
      - name: bundler
        state: latest
    
    npm_packages:
      - name: webpack
    
    pip_packages:
      - name: mkdocs

Any variable can be overridden in `config.yml`; see the supporting roles' documentation for a complete list of available variables.

## Included Applications / Configuration (Default)

My [dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles) are also installed into the current user's home directory, including the `.osx` dotfile for configuring many aspects of macOS for better performance and ease of use. You can disable dotfiles management by setting `configure_dotfiles: no` in your configuration.

Finally, there are a few other preferences and settings added on for various apps and services.

## Future additions

### Things that still need to be done manually

It's my hope that I can get the rest of these things wrapped up into Ansible playbooks soon, but for now, these steps need to be completed manually (assuming you already have Xcode and Ansible installed, and have run this playbook).

  1. Turn on **FileVault** under Security & Privacy preferences.
  2. turn off double-space yields `.`
      1. ⌘+Space, type: KeyboardSettings
      2. Click Text Input → Input sources → Edit
      3. Uncheck "Add full stop with double-space"
  4. **[Generate SSH key](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#ed25519-ssh-keys)** and add to GitLab & GitHub
  5. Add ssh key to keychain, so you don't have to retype the password each time you push/pull etc.
     In the latest version of MacOS (12.0 Monterey), just do this once:

     ```
     ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     ```

     `vim ~/.ssh/config` file, add the following lines:

      ```
       Host *
         UseKeychain yes
         AddKeysToAgent yes
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
      ```

  1. setup git details

      ```
      git config --global user.name "Your Name" /
      git config --global user.email you@example.com
      # automatically create upstream branch if not exists
      git config --global --add --bool push.autoSetupRemote true
      ```

  1. Install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
      - Download and extract, `cd ~/Downloads && ./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh`
  1. Install [Cloud SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy#install)

      ```
      cd ~ && curl -o cloud_sql_proxy https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.darwin.amd64 && chmod +x cloud_sql_proxy
      ```

  1. Add Sublime text key
  1. Add GitLab token for glab CLI tool `glab auth login` [GitLab Access Tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens)
  1. Clone all git repos. For every gitlab project in a group, use this one liner with curl, jq, tr

     ```
     for repo in $(curl -s --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: your_private_token" https://<your-host>/api/v4/groups/<group_id> | jq ".projects[].ssh_url_to_repo" | tr -d '"'); do git clone $repo; done;
     ```

     For Gitlab.com use <https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/><group_id>
  1. `nvm install --lts` (and edit `vi ~/.zshrc` to add nvm or through dotfiles)
  1. Add mail accounts to Thunderbird, addons:
      - [Nederlands woordenboek](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/woordenboek-nederlands/)
      - [DKIM verifier](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/dkim-verifier/?src=search)
      - [Thunderbird Conversations view](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view/) &ndash; makes mailbox more efficient & checks settings like offline storage, global search etc.
      - [Quicktext](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/quicktext/) &ndash; Templates\
  1. Thunderbird scaling for 4K display: Preferences > General > scroll to
     bottom > Config Editor > Search for `pixel and set`layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` to 1.5 or 2 (doesn't change everything). Also, change font size to 24px, that will change the size for reading emails but not the list of emails.
  1. Download books and put into Calibre
  2. [setup git-sync](https://github.com/Joostvanderlaan/git-sync) for git repos that need auto-sync like notes repo
  3. git-annex file management / backup folder sync, full overview
  
  1. Set JJG-Term as the default Terminal theme (it's installed, but not set as default automatically).
  2. Install [Sublime Package Manager](http://sublime.wbond.net/installation).
  3. Install all the apps that aren't yet in this setup (see below).
  4. Remap Caps Lock to Escape (requires macOS Sierra 10.12.1+).
  5. Set trackpad tracking rate.
  6. Set mouse tracking rate.
  7. Configure extra Mail and/or Calendar accounts (e.g. Google, Exchange, etc.).

### Workaround Intel vs Apple Silicon Mac
  
  I ran into the issue that `geerlingguy.homebrew` sets `/usr/local` as homebrew dir, which is fine for Intel macs but M1 macs should use `/opt/homebrew`. This is easily fixed by adding the var in default.config.yml, but apps were already installed by then. To remove them:

cd /Applications
rm -r "Authy Desktop.app" calibre.app darktable.app Docker.app Dropbox.app Figma.app Firefox.app Gimp-2.10.app "Google Chrome.app" "Backup and Sync.app" Handbrake.app Inkscape.app LibreOffice.app LICEcap.app Postman.app "Sequel Pro.app" Signal.app Spotify.app "Sublime Text.app" Thunderbird.app "Visual Studio Code.app" VLC.app

You can also set arch on Mac by using `arch -x86_64 brew remove <package>`

Also, could not get brew packages installed quickly. For now used directly instead of ansible script:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /opt/homebrew
chmod u+w /opt/homebrew
```

### Configuration to be added

- I have vim configuration in the repo, but I still need to add the actual installation:

    ```
    mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload
    mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
    cd ~/.vim/autoload
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/master/autoload/pathogen.vim > pathogen.vim
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
    ```

## Testing the Playbook

Many people have asked me if I often wipe my entire workstation and start from scratch just to test changes to the playbook. Nope! Instead, I posted instructions for how I build a [Mac OS X VirtualBox VM](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-osx-virtualbox-vm), on which I can continually run and re-run this playbook to test changes and make sure things work correctly.

Additionally, this project is [continuously tested on GitHub Actions' macOS infrastructure](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook/actions?query=workflow%3ACI).

## Notes

  6. for Apple silicon (non-Intel) mac `brew bundle dump`
  1. Install homebrew Intel as well for the formulae that are intel`arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"` (and you can now use `arch -x86_64 brew install <package>`)

> Note: If some Homebrew commands fail, you might need to agree to Xcode's license or fix some other Brew issue. Run `brew doctor` to see if this is the case.
